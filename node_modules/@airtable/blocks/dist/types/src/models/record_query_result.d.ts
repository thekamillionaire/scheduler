/**
 * Used to control what data is loaded in a {@link RecordQueryResult}. Used when creating a
 * query result using `table/view.selectRecords()` and in convenience hooks {@link useRecords}.
 *
 * ## sorts
 * Pass an array of sorts to control the order of records. The first sort in the array has the
 * highest priority. If you don't specify sorts, the result will use the inherent order of the
 * source model: the same order you'd see in the main UI for views and linked record fields, and
 * an arbitrary (but stable) order for tables.
 *
 * Record creation time is used as a tiebreaker: pass an empty array to sort by creation time.
 *
 * ```js
 * const opts = {
 *     sorts: [
 *         // sort by someField in ascending order...
 *         {field: someField},
 *         // then by someOtherField in descending order
 *         {field: someOtherField, direction: 'desc'},
 *     ]
 * };
 * const records = useRecords(table, opts);
 * const queryResult = table.selectRecords(opts);
 * ```
 *
 * ## fields
 * Generally, it's a good idea to load as little data into your block as possible - Airtable bases
 * can get pretty big, and we have to keep all that information in memory and up to date if you ask
 * for it. The fields option lets you make sure that only data relevant to you is loaded.
 *
 * You can specify fields with a {@link Field}, by ID, or by name:
 * ```js
 * const opts = {
 *     fields: [
 *         // we want to only load fieldA:
 *         fieldA,
 *         // the field with this id:
 *         'fldXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
 *         // and the field named 'Rating':
 *         'Rating',
 *     ],
 * };
 * const records = useRecords(table, opts);
 * const queryResult = table.selectRecords(opts);
 * ```
 *
 * ## recordColorMode
 * Just like a view in Airtable, you can control the colors of records in a field. There are three
 * supported record color modes: none, by a view, and by a select field.
 *
 * ```js
 * import {recordColoring} from '@airtable/blocks/models';
 * // No record coloring:
 * const opts = {
 *     recordColorMode: recordColoring.modes.none(),
 * };
 *
 * // Color according to the rules of a view:
 * const opts = {
 *     recordColorMode: recordColoring.modes.byView(someView),
 * };
 *
 * // Color by a single select field:
 * const opts = {
 *     recordColorMode: recordColoring.modes.bySelectField(someSelectField),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * You can access view coloring information directly from a {@link RecordQueryResult} or a
 * {@link Record}, but you can only directly access single select coloring from a RecordQueryResult:
 *
 * ```
 * const queryResult = table.selectRecords(opts);
 * const records = useRecords(table, opts);
 *
 * // Returns based on opts coloring mode
 * queryResult.getRecordColor(recordId);
 *
 * // Returns based on view
 * // Will throw if you did not pass recordColoring.modes.byView(view) in opts
 * records[0].getColorInView(view);
 * ```
 *
 * Use `record.getCellValue(singleSelectField).color` to access the color of a single select field
 * for a record.
 *
 * By default, views will have whichever coloring is set up in Airtable and tables won't have any
 * record coloring:
 *
 * ```js
 * // these two are the same:
 * someView.selectRecords();
 * someView.selectRecords({
 *     recordColorMode: recordColoring.modes.byView(someView),
 * });
 *
 * // as are these two:
 * someTable.selectRecords();
 * someTable.selectRecords({
 *     recordColorMode: recordColoring.modes.none(),
 * });
 * ```
 *

/**
 * A RecordQueryResult represents a set of records. It's a little bit like a one-off View in Airtable: it
 * contains a bunch of records, filtered to a useful subset of the records in the table. Those
 * records can be sorted according to your specification, and they can be colored by a select field
 * or using the color from a view. Just like a view, you can either have all the fields in a table
 * available, or you can just ask for the fields that are relevant to you. There are two types of
 * QueryResult:
 *
 * - {@link TableOrViewQueryResult} is the most common, and is a query result filtered to all the
 *   records in a specific {@link Table} or {@link View}. You can get one of these with
 *   `table.selectRecords()` or `view.selectRecords()`.
 * - {@link LinkedRecordsQueryResult} is a query result of all the records in a particular
 *   [linked record cell](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/206452848-Linked-record-fields).
 *   You can get one of these with `record.selectLinkedRecordsFromCell(someField)`.
 *
 * Once you've got a query result, you need to load it before you can start working with it -
 * blocks don't load record data by default. We recommend using {@link useRecords},
 * {@link useRecordIds}, {@link useRecordById} or {@link useLoadable} to handle this.
 *
 * If you're not using a query result in a React component, you can manually load the data and
 * unload it when you're finished:
 *
 * ```js
 * async function fetchRecordsAndDoSomethingAsync(myTable) {
 *     // query for all the records in "myTable"
 *     const queryResult = myTable.selectRecords();
 *
 *     // load the data in the query result:
 *     await queryResult.loadDataAsync();
 *
 *     // work with the data in the query result
 *     doSomething(queryResult);
 *
 *     // when you're done, unload the data:
 *     queryResult.unloadData();
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Whilst loaded, a query result will automatically keep up to date with what's in Airtable:
 * records will get added or removed, the order will change, cell values will be updated, etc.
 * Again, if you're writing a React component then our hooks will look after that for you. If not,
 * you can get notified of these changes with `.watch()`.
 *
 * When calling a `.select*` method, you can pass in a number of options to control the sort order,
 * fields loaded and coloring mode of records: see {@link RecordQueryResultOpts} for examples.
